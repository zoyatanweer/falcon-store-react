## Homepage

Homepage is the page where there is featured categories section. You can click on it and it will go to the products page with the selected category.

---

## Products

On Products page, initially there is list of the total items on the page. This page contains the 'Filter section' where on clicking a particular filter, the filtered data is displayed on the page.

The products page contains the list of items. In each item, there are two call to action buttons which are "Add to cart" and "wishlist icon"(which does the functionality of add to wishlist).

On clicking "Add to cart" , the product gets added to the cart (the cart icon in the header section notifies about the number of items in the cart). After adding it to the cart, the text on the "Add to cart" button changes to "Go to cart" which basically navigates the user to the cart page.

On clicking the "wishlist icon" the product gets added to wishlist page and the icon's color changes from black to pink. The wishlist icon in the header section notifies about the number of items in the wishlist.

(The "share button" on the card is currently not working. It will be implemented in coming days.)

## Wishlist

The Wishlist page has the items which the user had wishlisted. Here also if the user clicks on "Add to cart" , the products gets added to the cart and the user can navigate to the cart page after clicking on the button again.

To remove an item form the wishlist, the user has to click on the "wishlist icon" again in order to remove it from the wishlist.

---

## Cart

The Cart page has the items which the user had added to the cart. Items in this page have an additional feature which is 'increase or decrease' button. Here the user can increase or decrease the quantity of the product and accordingly, the badge on the cart icon on the navbar and the total price of the cart changes. The user can also remove the item from the cart by clicking on the "Remove from cart" and can also wishlist the item using "wishlist icon" .
